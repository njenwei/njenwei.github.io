This is the first post, and also a `test post`.

```bash
$ echo "This is the first post, and also a test post."
This is the first post, and also a test post.
```

Why not.

Resources I've used:

- [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) for domain name registration.
- Github pages for web hosting. The apex domain `njenwei.com` had to point to `www.njenwei.com` so that Github could manage the HTTPS certificates.
- [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for generating static files. It was easy to get started, however it seems to regenerate files quite slowly.
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling this website. I've never been great at web design, and tailwind provides a nice well documented CSS-less CSS framework with sensible defaults.
- [tailwindcss typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) for rendering markdown generated by jekyll in the `<article class="prose prose-sm">` block.
